Group members can have different powers. The *Manage Members* page is used to grant or revoke powers. The page allow either `single actions`_ to be carried out, granting or revoking a single power. It also allows `multiple actions`_ to be carried out. However, in its simplest use-case the page provides a `static view`_ of the members of the group.

Static View
===========

* The *Manage Members* page is visible to 

  + A group administrator and 
  + A site administrator.

* A *Permission Denied* error is shown to logged in
  
  + Group members
  + Site members
  
* A login page is shown to *Anonymous*.

* All group members are shown.

  + A group member who has the ``GroupAdmin`` role is marked as a
    *group administrator*.
  + A group member who has the ``DivisionAdmin`` role is marked as a
    *Site Administrator*.
  + A group member whose ID is set as the ``ptn_coach`` attribute of 
    the group is marked as the *Participation Coach*.
  + In an *announcement* group, a person who is listed in the
    ``posting_member`` attribute of the mailing list is listed as a
    *Posting Member*.
  + A group member who has no other status is marked as a *normal* group 
    member.

* People who have been invited to join the group are shown.

* Site members are not shown.
