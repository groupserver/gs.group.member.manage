Group members can have different powers. The *Manage Members* page is used to grant or revoke powers. The page allow either `single actions`_ to be carried out, granting or revoking a single power. It also allows `multiple actions`_ to be carried out. However, in its simplest use-case the page provides a `static view`_ of the members of the group.
